# wikiwho_rs

A high-performance Rust implementation of the WikiWho algorithm for token-level authorship tracking in Wikimedia pages.

## Overview

`wikiwho` is a Rust library that implements the [WikiWho algorithm](https://github.com/wikiwho/WikiWho), enabling users to track authorship on a token level (token â‰ˆ word) across all revisions of a Wikimedia page (e.g., Wikipedia, Wiktionary). It is designed to process entire Wikipedia/Wiktionary XML dumps efficiently, offering significant performance improvements over the original Python implementation by Fabian FlÃ¶ck and Maribel Acosta.

**Key Features:**

- **High Performance**: Processes large dumps in minutes instead of days.
- **Parallel Processing**: Designed for easy parallelization, leveraging Rust's concurrency capabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Separate parser and algorithm modules that can be used independently.
- **Faithful Implementation**: Aims to provide results comparable to the original algorithm, with an option to use the original Python diff algorithm for exact comparisons.

## Motivation

The original Python implementation of WikiWho could process about 300 pages in one to two minutes. In contrast, `wikiwho_rs` can process an entire German Wiktionary dump (approximately 1.3 million pages) in just 2 minutes using 8 processor cores. This performance boost makes large-scale authorship analysis feasible and efficient.

## Installation

Currently, `wikiwho` is available via its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Schuwi/wikiwho_rs). You can include it in your `Cargo.toml` as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]
wikiwho = { git = "https://github.com/Schuwi/wikiwho_rs.git" }
```

A release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) is planned soon.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a minimal example of how to load a Wikimedia XML dump and analyze a page:

```rust
use wikiwho::dump_parser::DumpParser;
use wikiwho::algorithm::Analysis;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the XML dump file
    let xml_dump = File::open("dewiktionary-20240901-pages-meta-history.xml")?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(xml_dump);
    let mut parser = DumpParser::new(reader)?;

    // Parse a single page
    if let Some(page) = parser.parse_page()? {
        // Analyze the page revisions
        let analysis = Analysis::analyse_page(&page.revisions)?;

        // Iterate over tokens in the current revision
        for token in wikiwho_rs::utils::iterate_revision_tokens(&analysis, &analysis.current_revision) {
            println!(
                "'{}' by '{}'",
                token.value,
                analysis[token].origin_revision.contributor.username
            );
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Processing an Entire Dump

To process a full dump, you can iterate over all pages:

```rust
use wikiwho::dump_parser::DumpParser;
use wikiwho::algorithm::Analysis;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let xml_dump = File::open("dewiktionary-20240901-pages-meta-history.xml")?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(xml_dump);
    let mut parser = DumpParser::new(reader)?;

    while let Some(page) = parser.parse_page()? {
        // Analyze each page in parallel or sequentially
        let analysis = Analysis::analyse_page(&page.revisions)?;

        // Your processing logic here
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Parallel Processing

While XML parsing is inherently linear, you can process pages in parallel once they are parsed:

- Run the parser in a single thread.
- Distribute parsed pages to worker threads for analysis.
- Use threading libraries like `std::thread` or crates like `rayon` for concurrency.

## Modules and API

### `dump_parser`

- **Purpose**: Parses Wikimedia XML dumps.
- **Usage**: Create a `DumpParser` instance with a reader, then call `parse_page()` to retrieve pages one by one.

### `algorithm`

- **Purpose**: Implements the WikiWho algorithm.
- **Usage**: Call `Analysis::analyse_page(&page.revisions)` to analyze the revisions of a page.

### `utils`

- **Purpose**: Provides utility functions.
- **Key Function**: `iterate_revision_tokens()` for easy iteration over tokens in a revision.

### Data Structures

- **Immutables and Analysis**: Nodes in the graph (revisions, paragraphs, sentences, tokens) are split into immutable and mutable parts for efficient processing.
- **Pointers**: Use pointer structs (e.g., `SentencePointer`) to reference nodes. Access mutable data via indexing into the `Analysis` struct (e.g., `analysis[word_pointer].origin_revision`).

## Dependencies

- **`compact_str`**: Used in the public API for efficient handling of mostly short strings, such as page titles and contributor names.

## Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Analysis**: Users are encouraged to implement parallel processing for the analysis phase to maximize performance.
- **Memory Usage**: The parser processes one page at a time, so memory usage is constant relative to the dump size. Ensure you drop processed `Page` and `Analysis` structs to free memory.
- **Diff Algorithm Choice**: By default, a faster diff algorithm is used. For exact results matching the original implementation, enable the `python-diff` feature.

## Features and Configuration

### Python Diff Feature

To use the original Python diff algorithm:

```toml
[dependencies]
wikiwho = { git = "https://github.com/Schuwi/wikiwho_rs.git", features = ["python-diff"] }
```

- **Note**: This significantly slows down processing as it calls the Python diff implementation via `pyo3`.
- **Purpose**: Useful for comparing results with the original implementation.

### Logging and Error Handling

- Uses the `tracing` crate for logging warnings and errors.
- The parser is designed to recover from errors. Enable the `strict` feature to terminate parsing on errors.

## Limitations

- **XML Format Compatibility**: Tested with Wikimedia dump XML format version 0.11. Dumps from other projects or versions may have variations.
- **Accuracy**: While aiming for faithful reimplementation, slight variations may occur due to the different diff algorithm.
- **Other Wiki Formats**: Optimized for Wikipedia-like wikis. Users can construct `Page` and `Revision` structs manually for other data sources.

## Future Plans

- **Benchmarking**: Implement rigorous benchmarks comparing performance with the original Python implementation.
- **Parser Improvements**: Consider separating the parser into a standalone crate.
- **Resumable Parsing**: Potentially add support for processing pages in chunks and resuming analysis.
- **Configuration Options**: Expose constants and settings within the algorithm for greater control.

## Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Includes tests that compare results with the original Python implementation.
- **Fuzzy Comparison Testing**: Plans to add tests that measure differences when using different diff algorithms.
- **Community Feedback**: Seeking input from users testing with different languages and datasets.
